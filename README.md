# esp32_u8g2_test
Test using u8g2 by Olikraus and the HAL provided by nKolban using Heltec wifi_kit_32

Just copy the u8g2_esp32_hal to your esp-idf/components folder and include the "u8g2_esp32_hal.h" in the header of your code to use the u8g2 libraby.

Instructions on how to setup the HAL and use the library could be found at:

i did nothing to the original files, just provided an easy way to copy the files and use it right away, because i was facing a lot of problems when trying to run the codes with this library+hal, so maybe it helps someone.
